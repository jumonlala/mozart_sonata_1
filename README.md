# Analyzing Two-Part and Three-Part Sonata Forms in Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 1

Sonata was one of the most prominent genres for solo piano music during the Classical period. Although sonata had existed before the Classical period, the two-part and three-part forms of sonata were not explicitly defined until the Classical period. Heinrich Christopher Koch was an influential music theorist who helped define the two-part form in his famous book, “Introduction Essay on Composition.” 

The two-part form is divided into two sections. The first section presents the opening themes. The first two phrases are in the tonic, while the third and fourth phrases modulate to a new key, typically the dominant or a relative major. The third phrase, where the modulation occurs, sometimes ends on a half cadence in the new key. The fourth phrase may be followed by an appendix in the new key. The second section often presents the opening themes in the dominant instead of the tonic; however, it can also introduce a new idea or start in a different key. The first period of the second section is characterized by its exploration of multiple keys distant from the tonic. It modulates back to the dominant and ends on a half cadence in the tonic. The tension from the first period resolves when the second period begins in the tonic. This period closely mirrors the first section, with everything now in the tonic, including the half cadence at the end of the third phrase.

The three-part form emerged in the 1830s and consists of three distinct sections: exposition, development, and recapitulation. The exposition resembles the first section of the two-part form, with the first two phrases identified as the first theme, followed by the transition that indicates modulation to the dominant or a relative major key. The theme presented after the transition is known as the second theme, which appears in the new key established during the modulation. The second theme tends to be slower and more lyrical than the first. The closing theme that follows creates a sense of direction and signals the end of the exposition, often with a subdivision of beats. Next is the development, the most tonally unstable and musically free section. The development often takes the themes from the exposition and presents them in new styles and keys. It modulates back to the tonic during the retransition and concludes with a half cadence in the tonic. The recapitulation begins in the tonic and presents the content from the exposition entirely in the tonic.

The key difference between the two-part and three-part forms lies in their treatment of the development section. Koch views development as more of an extension of the exposition in a different key, with the retransition functioning as an optional “modulating suffix” before the recapitulation (Petty 1999, 152-154). In contrast, the three-part form considers development as its own section, complete with a beginning and an end. The three-part form was influenced by works from the late 1700s and early 1800s, particularly those of Beethoven. Beethoven notably increased the complexity and length of the development section. His approach to exploring different keys, motifs, and themes during development became a model for music after 1800. Koch’s two-part form is more applicable to composers like Mozart, whose works emphasize "phrase structure and specific harmonic plans," while the three-part form aligns better with music that emerged after 1800, characterized by greater thematic diversity and depth (Burkholder, Grout, and Palisca 2019, 502). Additionally, the gradual disappearance of repetition in the second section made the binary structure less apparent, further establishing the three-part form as more suitable for the later pieces of the Classical period.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote 19 piano sonatas, six of which (K. 279-284) were completed during his trip to Munich in 1775. His Piano Sonata No. 1 in C Major (K. 279) reflects the influences of previous composers like J.C. Bach and Schobert, the galant style of the Classical period, and his mastery of counterpoints. This sonata will be analyzed to provide context for a deeper understanding of the two-part and three-part sonata forms. 

Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 1 in C Major begins the exposition (measures 1-12) with arpeggiated chords in the home key. These chords resemble harp textures, commonly used in operas for introductions. The first phrase (measures 1-4) establishes an arched contour featuring ascending and descending 16th notes. The second phrase (measures 5-12) lengthens this contour by adopting a slower rhythmic execution and incorporating chromatic steps, while the Alberti bass maintains a sense of continuous motion. Near the end of this phrase (measures 9-12), the first set of imitative ascending lines, played separately but consecutively by the bass and melody, concludes with a submediant chord, while the subsequent set of lines concludes with an authentic cadence. Together, these elements follow the antecedent and consequent phrasing structure, providing a sense of closure to the presentation of the first theme. 

The transition (measures 12-19) begins with a pronounced C7 chord, functioning as a secondary dominant of F major, which resolves immediately but is soon repeated. This creates an unstable harmonic tension, which is shortly relieved with the return to C major. It is followed by a half cadence in the home key and a medial caesura, which typically signal the end of the transition. However, they betray that expectation with consecutive chromatic 16th notes played by the bass and melody. These lines follow a diatonic progression from the mediant (E major) to the supertonic (D major), and finally to the dominant (G major), achieving the goal of modulating from the tonic to the dominant within the transition.

The second theme (measures 20-30) is presented in G major. The Alberti bass returns, but instead of ascending 16th notes, a series of descending 16th notes follows, creating an expectation of closure. Unlike the first theme, the second theme is harmonically ambiguous. For instance, the continuous chromatic descending 16th notes (measures 22-25) are in the key of D major, the dominant of G major. Rather than resolving this sense of anticipation by reverting to the tonic, Mozart employs a deceptive cadence with a submediant chord (measure 25). Following this deceptive cadence, the music transitions to a more lyrical character, enhancing the emotional depth of the moment. Tension resurfaces with an extremely chromatic rise and fall (measure 29), which is briefly resolved with a return to G major. The chromatic descending lines reemerge in the closing theme (measures 31-38). Ultimately, the final resolution occurs in the last two measures of the closing theme with an ascending arpeggiated G major chord.

The development (measure 39-57) presents the first theme in different keys. It begins with a G minor chord and explores various keys. This section first features a secondary dominant progression from A7 to D minor, followed by a diatonic progression from the supertonic (D minor) to the dominant (G major), and finally to the tonic (C major). Although the general rhythmic structure of the first six measures resembles the first four measures of the exposition, the use of arpeggios instead of a stepwise ascending motion creates a greater sense of turbulence. The progression is followed by a series of contrapuntal lines featuring descending intervals  (measures 44-47), which evokes a sense of downward spiraling motion. The second phrase of the exposition is restated in the key of C (measure 48-51), set up by the final measure of the descending lines. It closely mirrors the motif of the second phrase of the exposition, including the Alberti bass. The retransition (measure 51-57) begins with the returning contrapuntal lines, but this time maintaining an ascending movement, instead of descending. It creates a feeling of returning to the beginning. Typically, a half cadence in the tonic, in this case, C major, marks the end of the transition. However, instead of a half cadence, a continuous G major scale begins in measure 55, effectively establishing the dominant key. This ongoing scale enhances the overall fluidity of the piece, and the movement from the last note of the retransition, B (the leading tone), to the first note of the recapitulation, C (the tonic), creates a sense of quasi-resolution.

The recapitulation (measures 58-100) reinstates the themes from the exposition entirely in the tonic key. For instance, the transition begins with a resolution of the secondary dominant in C major instead of F major. While the first phrase mirrors the exposition exactly, the second phrase and the transition feature inverted melodic lines—where the exposition ascends, the recapitulation descends. This shift is evident at the end of the second theme, where the strongly chromatic rise and fall of the exposition transforms into an exclusively descending motion (measure 90). Additionally, motifs are rearranged. For example, the ascending contrapuntal motif from the second phrase of the exposition appears between the two ideas of the second theme in the recapitulation. 

In his Piano Sonata No. 1 in C Major (K. 279), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart uses diverse styles to convey feelings in different sections. In the exposition, he presents the first theme in the tonic, closing it with an antecedent and consequent phrasing structure. The transition modulates from the tonic to the dominant, with the half cadence in the dominant and the medial caesura creating a sense of suspension. The second theme is more lyrical and reflects harmonic ambiguity through deceptive cadences and chromaticism, contrasting with the first theme in character. The descending lines of the closing theme make the closure in the dominant exciting and definitive. The development section is the most harmonically unstable, exploring many keys and new ideas. In the absence of a half cadence at the end of the retransition and a fluid transition from the dominant to the tonic, the two-part form appears to better fit the structural form of this sonata. The exposition is restated completely in the tonic in the recapitulation, which, despite the recurring motifs, has a contrasting character thanks to Mozart’s breadth of styles and themes.
